# DELIVERING GROWTH

## Summary of business problem and project objective
The project aims to categorize customers into high, medium, and low potential groups and analyze their characteristics to help Swire Coca-Cola grow these accounts. By understanding order patterns and behaviors, the company can tailor strategies to increase sales and shift more customers to direct delivery routes.
Using historical sales data, the team will develop predictive models to identify customers likely to exceed volume thresholds and assess the impact of different distribution strategies.
Overall, the project supports data-driven decisions to enhance efficiency, customer service, and market expansion.

##  Your group's solution to the business problem
Our solution identifies high-growth customers and analyzes their characteristics to understand what drives their growth. This allows Swire Coca-Cola to target similar accounts and apply effective strategies to increase sales and improve distribution efficiency.

##  Your contribution to the project
My contribution focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and identifying the state-wise distribution of high-volume customers based on delivered cases and gallons. I also provided recommendations to optimize logistics by highlighting regions with strong demand and potential for more efficient delivery routes.

## The business value of the solution
Our solution enables Swire Coca-Cola to focus on customers with the highest growth potential, optimize delivery routes, and empower sales reps—ultimately reducing costs, increasing revenue, and driving strategic market expansion.

## Difficulties that your group encountered along the way
One key challenge was identifying the right threshold to define high-growth customers. After exploring different approaches, we decided to use XGBoost modeling, which helped us uncover clear customer segments based on growth potential. This allowed us to move forward with more targeted recommendations.

## What you learned in the project
This project gave us hands-on experience with real-world data challenges—from cleaning messy datasets to applying machine learning for customer segmentation. While not everything went perfectly, we learned how to adapt, make decisions as a team, and turn analysis into business recommendations. It was a valuable learning experience overall.
